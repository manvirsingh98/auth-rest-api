"# auth-restApi" 
 
Used Stack:

Nodejs/Express
MongoDB/cluster

//npm Modules
@hapi/joi -> form validation
JWT ->  to create token
bycrypt -> hasing password
cors -> send data one to another http
body-parser -> to get form data in json
hbs -> fot html templating
dotenv -> to set environment variable seperatly
mongoose -> to connect with mongoDB
nodemon -> to run server automatically after changes


I created a REST API Login Auth and also create Private IP which only access through Header and JWT token.
